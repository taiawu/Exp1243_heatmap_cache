This report was generated with the shiny app
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# For PDF output, change the header to have "output: pdf_document".
#
# Note that due to an issue in rmarkdown, the default value of a parameter in
# the header cannot be `NULL`, so I used a default of `NA` for the default value
# of `n`.
```

```{r}
# The `params` object is available in the document.
params$n
```

```{r}
# The plots themselves have to be regenerated in the markdown (annoying)
# so define the plotting function, and then pass the data to this rmd to show the plots
```
